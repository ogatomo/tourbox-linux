# TourBox Elite Configuration GUI

Graphical interface for configuring TourBox Elite button mappings and application-specific profiles.

## Installation

The GUI dependencies are **automatically installed** by the main `install.sh` script. If you performed a manual installation, ensure you have the GUI dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r tourboxelite/gui/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the GUI

```bash
tourbox-gui
```

The installer creates a launcher script in `/usr/local/bin/tourbox-gui` that you can run from anywhere.

   - Real-time feedback when pressing physical buttons
   - Set up window matching rules with "Capture Active Window"

3. **On Exit:**
   - Saves changes to configuration file
   - Automatically restarts the driver service

## Features

- **Visual Controller Display:** See which button you're configuring
- **Profile Management:** Create, edit, and delete profiles

## Architecture

The GUI is built with:
- **PySide6:** Qt 6 bindings for cross-desktop compatibility
- **qasync:** Integration between Qt and asyncio for BLE operations
- **Bleak:** Bluetooth Low Energy communication (reused from driver)

All GUI code is self-contained in this directory and does not modify the existing driver code.
