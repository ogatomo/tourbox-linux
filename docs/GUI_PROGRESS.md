# TourBox Elite Configuration GUI - Development Progress

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-05
**Status:** Feature Complete - Visual controller representation with highlighting implemented

## Project Overview

Building a Qt-based GUI application for configuring TourBox Elite button mappings and application-specific profiles on Linux. This provides feature parity with the official Windows/Mac TourBox software.

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.9+
- PySide6 (Qt 6)
- qasync (Qt/asyncio integration)
- Bleak (Bluetooth LE)
- Reuses existing driver code from `tourboxelite/` modules

**Documentation:**
- [Full PRD](GUI_PRD.md) - Complete product requirements
- [GUI README](../tourboxelite/gui/README.md) - Usage and architecture

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. Project Structure
- Created `tourboxelite/gui/` directory with modular architecture
- All GUI code is self-contained and doesn't modify existing driver
- Can run with: `tourbox-gui` (launcher script) or `python -m tourboxelite.gui`

**Implementation:** `controller_view.py`, `tourboxelite/gui/assets/tourbox_elite.svg`

### 🚧 Partially Implemented

#### BLE Connection
- ✅ Module structure created (`ble_listener.py`)
- ✅ Connection and unlock code written (reuses driver code)
- ❌ Not integrated into main window yet
- ❌ No button press detection → control selection

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

#### 1. BLE Connection & Real-time Input
**What's needed:**
- Connect to TourBox on GUI launch (after stopping driver)
- Listen for button press notifications
- Map BLE codes to control names
- Trigger control selection in UI
- Handle connection errors gracefully

**Implementation approach:**
- Create BLEListener instance in main_window
- Connect signals to UI slots
- Use qasync to integrate asyncio with Qt event loop
- Reuse unlock sequence and notification handler from driver

**Files to modify:**
- `main_window.py` - Create and manage BLEListener
- `ble_listener.py` - Complete implementation
- Need to load MAC address from config

#### 2. Advanced Features (LOWER PRIORITY)
- Profile import/export
- Macro recording
- Undo/redo for changes
- Live preview without restarting driver
- Configuration presets for popular apps

## Known Issues

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ Row 0 showing blank due to table cell span not being cleared
- ✅ Columns not filling width after profile change (removed resizeColumnsToContents call)
- ✅ Symbol keys showing as "Brace" instead of actual symbols
- ✅ Editor parsing taking wrong character from key names
- ✅ Variable name collision with `except Exception as e:` shadowing evdev import
- ✅ Arrow keys (LEFT, RIGHT) being stripped from display
- ✅ Multi-word keys showing underscores instead of spaces
- ✅ Mouse wheel actions showing raw format (WHEEL:1) instead of human-readable
- ✅ Zoom keys and Context Menu missing from dropdown
- ✅ Inconsistent display of unmapped vs none controls
- ✅ Key matching failing for multi-word keys with spaces
- ✅ Status bar disappearing after adding menu/toolbar
- ✅ Test button grayed out on startup

### Current Issues
None known at this time.

**Not yet tested:**
- BLE connection to actual device (for real-time button detection in GUI)
- Physical button presses triggering control selection

## Next Session Priorities

### Optional Enhancements (Future Sessions)
1. **Implement BLE connection** - Real-time button press detection in GUI
   - Would enable clicking physical buttons to select controls in GUI
   - Not critical since testing mode already allows testing with physical device
2. **Polish & improvements** - Based on real-world usage feedback
3. **Documentation updates** - User guide for GUI features

### Core Functionality Status
**✅ COMPLETE - GUI is fully functional for its primary purpose:**
- Edit button mappings with visual interface
- Visual TourBox representation with control highlighting
- Save changes preserving config format
- Test configurations with physical device
- Complete profile management (create, edit, delete, window matching)
- No manual config file editing required

## Development Notes

### Important Code Locations

**Reusable driver code:**
- `tourboxelite/config_loader.py` - Config parsing (already used)
- `tourboxelite/window_monitor.py` - Window detection (for profile matching)
- `tourboxelite/device_ble.py` - BLE constants and unlock sequence

**GUI entry point:**
```bash
# Using launcher script (installed to ~/.local/bin/)
tourbox-gui

# Or directly via Python module
source venv/bin/activate
python -m tourboxelite.gui
```

**Logging:**
Currently set to DEBUG level in `main_window.py:main()`. Can change to INFO for production.

### Design Decisions

**Why Qt instead of GTK:**
- Better cross-desktop compatibility (KDE + GNOME)
- More polished widget set
- Project already supports both KDE and GNOME equally

**Why not save on Apply:**
- Allows user to experiment without modifying config
- Prevents accidental overwrites
- Explicit save action is clearer for users

**Symbol mapping approach:**
- Maintain SYMBOL_MAP dict in multiple files
- Could be refactored to shared utility module
- Trade-off: duplication vs. complexity

### Code Style Notes

- Using Qt signals/slots for component communication
- Logging extensively for debugging
- Human-readable display names separate from internal names
- Error handling with user-friendly dialogs

## Session Summary: Controller Visualization (2025-11-05)

### What Was Accomplished
This session focused on implementing visual representation of the TourBox Elite with interactive control highlighting:

**Major Features Added:**
1. **SVG Artwork Creation** (Inkscape)
   - Custom TourBox Elite illustration with accurate layout
   - Background layer with complete device drawing
   - Controls layer with 20 individual highlight overlays (yellow fills)
   - Proper object IDs for all controls matching control names
   - Hidden controls by default, shown on selection

2. **SVG Rendering System** (`controller_view.py`)
   - QSvgRenderer with dynamic SVG XML manipulation
   - Loads base SVG showing background only
   - On control selection, modifies SVG in memory to show specific highlight
   - Renders both base and highlight to same target rectangle for perfect alignment
   - Automatic scaling with aspect ratio preservation

3. **Integration & Polish**
   - Control highlights appear when selecting from Controls Configuration table
   - Real-time visual feedback for selected control
   - Window resizable with proper SVG scaling
   - Initial window size optimized to 1280x1024
   - Panel sizes adjusted for better visual balance

### Technical Approach
- **Challenge**: Qt's QSvgRenderer renders individual elements with different coordinate systems
- **Solution**: Parse SVG with ElementTree, modify display:none → display:inline for selected control
- **Result**: Both background and highlight render using same transformation, ensuring perfect alignment

### Lines of Code Changed
- Modified: `controller_view.py` (complete rewrite of rendering logic, ~210 lines)
- Modified: `main_window.py` (window sizing adjustments)
- New asset: `tourboxelite/gui/assets/tourbox_elite.svg` (custom artwork)

### Result
**Complete visual feedback system:** Users can now see exactly which control they're editing with a beautiful, scalable TourBox Elite representation. The GUI is now visually polished and provides excellent UX.

**Status:** Ready for real-world usage and user feedback!
